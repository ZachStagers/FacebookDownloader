# FacebookDownloader
A selenium/Python based project to loop through all of the logged in accounts profile images on Facebook and download them locally (including all of the tagged in pictures not included in Facebook's own data download tool). 

This project is not being actively maintained by me, but worked perfectly for my escape from Facebook in August 2020.
